      <Data>
        <string>Long ago, the members of the Ghouls were part of respected clans, forming the rearguard in the vast orcish wars. As success and glory grew within the orcish army, the once respected latecomers degenerated to ghouls, searching the enemies' corpses for valuable loot. Now, the Ghouls are a disgusting pack of vermin.</string>
		<string>The Coopers craft barrels and chests of all kind. They are one of the first craftsmen forming a guild. Their financial power ensured wealth and influence in the orcish politics. Anyway, they are often underestimated by the other craft guilds.</string>
		<string>Beyond the other crafts, the guild of blacksmiths is one of the most known and respected craftsmen guilds in the lands. Especially, because smithery plays a major role in the orcish culture which is a synonym for war. Across the major clans, every smith has to be part of this guild.</string>
		<string>Like the name let one assume, the Spearhead is a clan which provides foolhardy warriors for the front line. They could have something like family related tradition, but because of the low expectancy of life, they recruit foreign orcs in tremendous dimensions.</string>
		<string>This clan spread fear and trepidation during the civil war. They performed a bloody inquisition against the defeated, and after they were smoked out, against themselves. They call themselves the twisted dragon who clasps his enemies. The people just call them the hydra who bites off her own heads.</string>
		<string>The War Chant clan's purpose is to shape and exercise the orcish musical side. Their war songs are famous and played a lot, whether it is a calm social gathering or on the bloody battlegrounds.</string>
		<string>The Miners are from a despised caste of workers. They dig for valuable resources and unearth the minerals the whole orcish crafting culture relies on. In the recent years, the big community of miners has been getting more and more restive and aggressive.</string>
		<string>The Berserker clan provides the manpower for the orcish forces. They are under the control of the current ruling warlord. Orcs, who strive for a simple life with an assured income normally overrun to this clan, if they were not already born in it.</string>
		<string>Eye of Mind is a coalition of shamans across the country. Their main purpose is to call old ghosts and to bind them to objects, mainly artifacts. Some of the shamans partake in dubious practices and if a descendant didn't liked his parents that much, the deceased father or mother could end as a living faucet on the black market.</string>
		<string>Like no other clan, the Historian clan forms the building staff of the orcish society, tutoring young orcs to scholars. Beyond that, they write down the orcish history. These chronicles are stored and are public available in the capital's library.</string>
		<string>The Raven Covenant is a discreet and secretive organizations which main purpose is kept in the dark, too. Battle-scarred and political motivated, they may be the puppet masters behind the curtain.</string>
		<string>As an old and stable clan, the Fishermen can look back on a long and flourish tradition. The fishers' handcraft is pursued with a lot of proud and tight regulations. Devotees of this lifestyle have to come along with a lot of courage: the orcish swamps can be scarier and more dangerous then every battleground out there.</string>
		<string>Yes, the hawkers are organized in a kind of Hawker clan, while still partially belonging to their original clans. The clan regulates prices, trading zones and tolls. Part of their income is taxed and in return, they enjoy a certain degree of neutrality among the clans.</string>
		<string>The Spirit Brew clan is a shaman circle which specialized on brewing and cooking. While they work wonders in their kettles from time to time, they are often mistrusted and excluded from the overall social life. As a result, they often live isolated in the woods and visit nearby towns only for trading.</string>
		<string>The First Scouts clan shakes the boundaries of the orcish world over and over again. Expedition ships and a rich and extensive library of maps are their fundamentals and their lines are filled with enthusiastic orcs.</string>
		<string>The Backbone clan is a colloquial label of the orcish lumberjacks out there, because they are metaphorical the backbone of the orcish empire. Without their strength and knowledge of building wood chopping machines, the orcs would still live in thin tents instead of huge orcish cities.</string>

        <string>[color=58,174,255]Satiation:[/] Drops over time and is refilled by eating crops (like barley) from the sleeping box or a feeding box. If the satiation is too low, the pigeon can't fly out for exploration tours, breed or gain experience. Furthermore, curiosity, libido and happiness don't increase until the pigeon is fed.</string>
		<string>[color=58,255,148]Stamina:[/] Drops over time and is refilled by staying in the sleeping box. If the stamina is too low, the pigeon can't fly out for exploration tours, breed or gain experience. Furthermore, curiosity, libido and happiness don't increase until the pigeon is rested.</string>
		<string>[color=255,197,58]Curiosity:[/] Increases over time if not locked in the sleeping box, hungry or tired. If full, the pigeon makes an exploration tour and will bring back a random item. The Gatherer skill and the current happiness decide the rarity of the found loot and the type of the recent food the loot's quality (higher crop tiers like wheat result in a higher quality than something like barley).</string>
		<string>[color=255,108,108]Libido:[/] Increases over time if not locked in the sleeping box, hungry or tired. If full, the pigeon searchs for a breeding partner. Both pigeons have to be ready and of different gender. The Super Genotype skill and the current happiness of both pigeons decide how many skills the child will get at birth and the High Quality skill decides the egg's quality (if you want to eat it...).</string>
		<string>[color=255,108,255]Happiness:[/] Increases over time if satiated and rested. It also depends on the quality of the recently eaten crops and the Happiness skill. The happiness affects exploration tours, breeding and many more.</string>
		<string>[color=150,150,150]Age:[/] Drops over time and if empty, the pigeon will die. Pigeons can also die during bad weather.</string>

		<string>Seed Properties</string>
		<string>If you hover over a seed in the seed pouch's menu, you will see some seed information popping up. It tells you the seed's desired wetness, eutrophy, windbreak and plant density.</string>
		<string>FARMING</string>
		
		<string>Tile Properties</string>
		<string>These properties (wetness, eutrophy, windbreak and plant density) relate to the ground's characteristics.</string>
		<string>FARMING</string>
		
		<string>Wetness</string>

		<string>FARMING</string>
		
		<string>Seed Property Target</string>
		<string>As an example, the barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,250,100,50,50][/] seeds needs an eutrophy of 4 indicated by the 4/6 filled yellow circle [scale=0.75,true,false][icon=8,1203,395,27,27][/].</string>
		<string>FARMING</string>
		
		<string>Seed Property Importance</string>
		<string>But reaching this eutrophy characteristic isn't so important for the barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,250,100,50,50][/] seed as it is labeled only with one diamond.</string>

		<string>Stamina</string>
		<string>Before you progress, check your stamina [scale=0.75,true,false][icon=8,1172,368,24,24][/]. Perhaps it is already low because it's getting dark. If so, just sleep through the dusk and night!</string>
		<string>RELAXING</string>
		
		<string>Relaxing</string>
		<string>If it's dusk or night, go to sleep to restore your stamina [scale=0.75,true,false][icon=8,1172,368,24,24][/]. If it's in the morning or midday, use the fishing rod ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,343,487,48,45][/]) instead.</string>

		<string>The first production object you will check out is the furnace [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,450,150,50,50][/]. It is used to bake bread [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,950,0,50,50][/] and fish [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,800,0,50,50][/] and to melt iron ores [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,650,300,50,50][/] to iron [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,700,300,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>FURNACE</string>
		
		<string>Fuel</string>
		<string>To fuel the furnace, you have to put a piece of wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] into it. Click on the furnace and transfer a piece of wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] like interacting with a storage. Click on the wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] item and then on 'Put In'.</string>
		<string>FURNACE</string>
		
		<string>Burning Duration</string>
		<string>How many burning processes the furnace can perform depends on the quality of the wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] you put in. A piece of wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] with zero quality [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,936,0,35,25][/] will get destroyed after one production.</string>
		<string>FURNACE</string>
		
		<string>Baking and Melting</string>
		<string>To bake bread [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,950,0,50,50][/], put barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/] or other cereal crops in the furnace. You can also put raw fish [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,650,0,50,50][/] in it or iron ores [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,650,300,50,50][/] to melt iron [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,700,300,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>FURNACE</string>
		
		<string>Production</string>
		<string>The production takes some time. The product can be gathered from the furnace like from a storage. If a chest is placed near the furnace, the product gets automatically transferred to it.</string>
		<string>FURNACE</string>
		
		<string>Automatic Refill</string>
		<string>After the furnace finished production, it tries to refill itself with material stored in nearby storages. Therefore, if you are baking a bread [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,950,0,50,50][/], put some wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] and barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/] into the chest nearby.</string>
		<string>FURNACE</string>
		
		
		<string>Hub Menu</string>
		<string>Before you start to brew beer, check which clan will visit you. To open the hub, press [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/] (it's a temporary interface!).</string>
		<string>CLANS</string>
		
		<string>Clan Info and Upgrades</string>
		<string>The hub menu has two pages: a clan info page and a page full of upgrades (none available yet). You can navigate through these screens with the buttons at the bottom.</string>
		<string>CLANS</string>
		
		<string>Clan Info</string>
		<string>The clan info page lists all the desires of this clan. The diamonds [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1147,423,28,15][/] show how much they want of a certain property, the bars show how much this property is currently satisfied.</string>
		<string>CLANS</string>
		
		<string>Reputation</string>
		<string>Satisfying a clan lets you gain reputation [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1240,368,18,18][/] over time which then can be spend on upgrades. Reputation [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1240,368,18,18][/] is shown at the top left corner of the screen.</string>
		<string>CLANS</string>
		
		<string>Social Rank</string>
		<string>If you satisfy a clan enough (overall satisfaction above 70%), you increase in social rank [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1259,368,18,18][/] and the next clan with a different taste will visit you. The social rank [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1259,368,18,18][/] is displayed at the top left.</string>
		<string>CLANS</string>
		
		<string>Upgrades</string>
		<string>Every upgrade you saw in the hub menu has multiple levels, which are accessible after reaching a higher social rank [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1259,368,18,18][/] and bought with reputation [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1240,368,18,18][/] as currency.</string>
		<string>CLANS</string>
		
		
		<string>Satisfaction</string>
		<string>If you press [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/], you will see that the overall satisfaction is split up in multiple beer characteristics and a demanded comfort. Now you will brew a fitting beer.</string>
		<string>BREWING</string>
		
		<string>Required Items</string>
		<string>For the whole brewing process, we need yeast [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,600,50,50,50][/], barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/], hop [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,0,50,50][/] and wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/]. If you have to buy yeast [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,600,50,50,50][/] from the hawker, harvest hop [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,0,50,50][/] or chop some wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/], do it now.</string>
		<string>BREWING</string>
		
		<string>Big Picture</string>
		<string>Then walk to your production hall below your inn with all the pipes in it. The beer brewing is done in 3 steps: producing malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/], making wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/] out of malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] and finally beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] out of wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>BREWING</string>
		
		
		<string>Malt</string>
		<string>Producing malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] with the wooden malt box defines the final beer's [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] taste (like barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/]) and tint darkness.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Taste</string>
		<string>Open the hub menu by pressing [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/] and check which taste the visiting clan wants (it's barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/]). Close the hub menu then.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Malt Box</string>
		<string>Click on the wooden malt box [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,150,50,50][/]. The basket opens and you can interact with the malt box like with a storage respectively the furnace. At first, put a piece of wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] in it as well as a barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/] crop.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Tint Darkness</string>
		<string>As the malt box defines the final beer's [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] tint darkness, you have to check what tint darkness the visiting clan wants.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Check Tint Darkness</string>
		<string>Press [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/] and check how many bright colored yellow diamonds are left to the label 'Tint Darkness'.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Getting Water</string>
		<string>The tint darkness is controlled by the amount of water in the malt box. Equip the bucket ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,392,487,48,45][/]) and then perform a right click [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,60,359,29,35][/] on the water pool in front of your inn and your bucket will be filled.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Controlling Tint Darkness</string>
		<string>Now perform left clicks on the malt box while the filled water bucket is equipped. Every click adds water to the malt box.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Undo</string>
		<string>If you put in too much, perform a right click [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,60,359,29,35][/] to get all the water out of the malt box.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Set Correct Tint Darkness</string>
		<string>If the hub menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/]) indicates a tint darkness of zero, you have to put one unit water into the malt box. If it's a tint darkness of one, you need two units water and so on.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Unperfect Match</string>
		<string>If you sell a not perfectly matching beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] to a clan, you are not doomed. The visitors just get less satisfied depending on how far the drunk beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] differs from the clan's taste.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Malt Production</string>
		<string>The malt box produces if small corns pop out at the bottom. It will try to put the malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] into a near storage and get the materials (wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/], barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/] and water) from near storages to keep running.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Pipes</string>
		<string>The interaction of the malt box (and other production objects) isn't restricted to nearby storages. Further storages can be connected via overground and underground pipes of different types.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Pipe Visualization</string>
		<string>Click on the [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,641,820,24,24][/] button at the bottom of the screen or press [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,98,441,48,45][/] to switch through the pipe visualizations. The button's tooltip has further details.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Pipe Types</string>
		<string>There are different types of pipes. Input pipes [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,280,813,18,18][/] let producing objects draw material from connected storages, output pipes [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,299,813,18,18][/] let them put the products into the storages and combined pipes [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,318,813,18,18][/] do both.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Underground Pipes</string>
		<string>While overground pipes are less expensive to build, underground pipes aren't visible and can go through inaccessible terrain and walls. Underground pipes are colored blue in the pipe visualization.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Connection Points</string>
		<string>If you click on the malt box [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/], you noticed four white circles [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,307,832,26,26][/] around the malt box. They indicate the places where it tries to interact with storages and pipes.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Malt Box Input</string>
		<string>The malt box [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] is connected to the rain barrels via an overground input pipe and to both chests via an underground pipe.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Malt Box Output</string>
		<string>The malt box [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] is placed above the left chest, so it will put its malt automatically in this chest.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Ensure Materials</string>
		<string>To keep the automatic malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] production running, put some wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] and barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/] in one of the chests.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		<string>Rain Barrels</string>
		<string>If the rain barrels [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,150,50,50][/] are empty, fill them with water. Equip the bucket ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,392,487,48,45][/]), right click [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,60,359,29,35][/] on the water and left click [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,30,359,29,35][/] on the rain barrel.</string>
		<string>BREWING MALT</string>
		
		
		<string>Wort</string>
		<string>The next step is producing wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/], so wait a bit until the malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] production outputs its first malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/], select the hands tool ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,49,487,48,45][/]), click on the chest and grab the malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>BREWING WORT</string>
		
		<string>Inherit Properties</string>
		<string>Like the malt box defines the taste and tint darkness, the wort boiler sets the final beer's [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] full body and inherits taste and tint darkness from the used malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>BREWING WORT</string>
		
		<string>Full Body</string>
		<string>Open the hub menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/]) and check, how many bright diamonds are left to the 'Full Body' label.</string>
		<string>BREWING WORT</string>
		
		<string>Wort Boiler</string>
		<string>Now place some wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] and the malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] into the wort boiler [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,150,50,50][/] (the cauldron). Again, you control the full body characteristic of the produced wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/] with water.</string>
		<string>BREWING WORT</string>
		
		<string>Met Full Body</string>
		<string>Refill you water bucket and put as many water into the wort boiler as required. If the clan wants a full body of zero, put one water in it respectively two water for one full body etc.</string>
		<string>BREWING WORT</string>
		
		<string>Wort Production</string>
		<string>As the boiler interacts with nearby storages and pipes, you have an automatic wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/] production. The wort boiler will grab malt [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,300,50,50,50][/] from the chests put in by the malt box.</string>
		<string>BREWING WORT</string>
		
		
		<string>Beer Brewing Kettle</string>
		<string>The big kettle [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,400,150,50,50][/] in the room is used to make beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] out of wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/]. Wait until some wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/] is produced and get one wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/] out of the nearby chests.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Further Materials</string>
		<string>You also need some wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/], hop [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,0,50,50][/] and yeast [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,600,50,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Prepare the Kettle</string>
		<string>Place wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] into the brewing kettle as well as the wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/]. The beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] will inherit taste, tint darkness and full body from the used wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Check Acerbity</string>
		<string>Open the hub menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/]) and check how acerbic the clan wants their beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Acerbity</string>
		<string>Then put enough hop [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,0,50,50][/] into the brewing kettle to met their taste. If they want an acerbity of zero, put one hop [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,0,50,50][/] into it. For an acerbity of one, put two hop [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,0,50,50][/] in it and so on.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Alcoholic Strength</string>
		<string>The amount of yeast [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,600,50,50,50][/] controls the alcoholic strength. Check the hub menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/]) for the clan's favored alcoholic strength and put enough yeast [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,600,50,50,50][/] into the kettle.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Flavor</string>
		<string>You will get visited by clans which also demand a flavor. To meet it, you can put such a special crop into the brewing kettle, too. The visiting clan doesn't want any, so ignore it.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Minimal Quality</string>
		<string>If you checked the hub menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/]), you also noticed a 'Minimal Quality'. It relates to the beer's [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] quality, which depends on the quality of all the used materials.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Storage Interaction</string>
		<string>Like the other production objects, the beer brewing kettle will grab wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/], wort [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,350,50,50,50][/], hop [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,0,50,50][/] and yeast [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,600,50,50,50][/] from nearby storages or storages connected via input or combined pipes.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Automatic Production</string>
		<string>Put enough wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/], hop [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,0,50,50][/] and yeast [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,600,50,50,50][/] into the chests to keep the beer brewing kettle running.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Beer Brewing Kettle Output</string>
		<string>As beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] has to be stored in barrels [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,250,150,50,50][/] instead of chests, the beer brewing kettle will try to put its produced beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] into nearby or connected barrels or faucets.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Faucet Connection</string>
		<string>The kettle is connected to a special type of barrel (with a kind of wooden tree creature sitting on top of it) through the wall with the help of underground output pipes.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		<string>Faucets</string>
		<string>This faucet [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,150,50,50][/] will sell beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] to your visitors and your brewing kettle prioritizes filling them over the other storage barrels.</string>
		<string>BREWING BEER</string>
		
		
		<string>Recipe Management</string>
		<string>There is a book opened by pressing [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,98,395,48,45][/] or clicking on the [scale=0.6,true,false][icon=8,691,670,50,50][/] symbol. The clan and upgrade hub menu will be moved to this book in the future.</string>
		<string>COOKING RECIPES</string>
		
		<string>Recipe Creation</string>
		<string>In this book, you can create new brewing and cooking recipes, which can be then applied to the beer production machines. The recipe for the first clan is already created.</string>
		<string>COOKING RECIPES</string>
		
		<string>Use of Recipes</string>
		<string>Attaching these recipes to the malt box, wort boiler and brewing kettle allows you to change the production very fast and comfortable.</string>
		<string>COOKING RECIPES</string>
		
		<string>Attach Recipes</string>
		<string>To attach a recipe to a production machine, select the object and click on the [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=8,362,222,31,31][/] button above the production's progress arrow.</string>
		<string>COOKING RECIPES</string>
		
		
		<string>Comfort</string>
		<string>The beer production will take some time and instead of waiting, we will check another clan requirement: the comfort. It depends on the room the visitors will drink their beer in.</string>
		<string>COMFORT</string>
		
		<string>Minimal Comfort</string>
		<string>The visiting clan wants a minimal comfort. Open the hub menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/]) to check the clan's required minimal comfort. It's the percentage left to the 'Comfort' label.</string>
		<string>COMFORT</string>
		
		<string>Show Comfort</string>
		<string>A room's comfort can be showed by equipping the shovel ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,98,487,48,45][/]). A purple bar will appear on the room and small dots indicate the room's border.</string>
		<string>COMFORT</string>
		
		<string>Increasing Comfort</string>
		<string>To increase a room's comfort, you can place decorational objects into it, like fireplaces or vases. The 'Indoor Inn' category [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,850,150,50,50][/] in the building menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,98,487,48,45][/]) has some of this stuff.</string>
		<string>COMFORT</string>
		
		<string>Comfort Points</string>
		<string>If you hover over such an element, it tells you how many comfort points it adds to the room.</string>
		<string>COMFORT</string>
		
		<string>Room Comfort</string>
		<string>The final comfort of a room is not only based on the sum of all comfort points from decorational elements within the room, but also depends on the room's size.</string>
		<string>COMFORT</string>
		
		<string>Minimal Comfort Met?</string>
		<string>Check in the hub menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/]) if your inn exceeds the required minimal comfort. If not, place some further decorational stuff.</string>

		<string>NEXT CLAN</string>
		
		<string>Clan Taste</string>
		<string>Every clan has a different taste, but they can overlap. Therefore, you will have to decide if you construct a new beer production, reuse parts or accept the lower satisfaction.</string>
		<string>NEXT CLAN</string>
		
		<string>Upgrades</string>
		<string>Don't forget to spend your reputation [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1240,368,18,18][/] on upgrades in the hub menu ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/]) if your social rank [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1259,368,18,18][/] increased. With a social rank [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1259,368,18,18][/] of one, the first stage of all upgrades is available.</string>
		<string>NEXT CLAN</string>

		<string>NEXT CLAN</string>
		
		<string>Extending</string>
		<string>Therefore, you will have to extend your inn or build a new one somewhere else with more space.</string>
		<string>NEXT CLAN</string>
		
		<string>Room</string>
		<string>If you build a new inn, don't forget to ensure that it's a room (surrounded by walls/doors and the ground covered with indoor floors).</string>
		<string>NEXT CLAN</string>
		
		<string>Interior</string>
		<string>Visitors also need a faucet with beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] and a chair near a table or bar as well as a minimal comfort.</string>
		<string>NEXT CLAN</string>
		
		
		<string>Final</string>
		<string>The following slides provide some in-depth information, but if you want, you can close the tutorial now and create an awesome inn and reaching a high social rank [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1259,368,18,18][/].</string>
		<string>FINAL</string>
		
		
		<string>Bad Weather</string>
		<string>Some of the bad weather, like hail or storm, can damage objects. A health bar appears on them if they are damaged and the hammer-axe ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,487,48,45][/]) is equipped.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Repairing</string>
		<string>Damaged objects can be repaired by performing a right click [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,60,359,29,35][/] on them with the hammer-axe. This will cost money [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1221,368,18,18][/].</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Fishing</string>
		<string>Try to place your swimmer strategically and if a small water pool doesn't seem to have any fishs, you probably won't catch anything there.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Shortcuts I</string>
		<string>Use all the short cuts, especially [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,784,441,48,45][/] and [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,196,441,48,45][/] for the pouch and basket, [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,98,395,48,45][/]/[scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,147,395,48,45][/] for the hub menus and [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,245,441,48,45][/], [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,294,441,48,45][/], [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,343,441,48,45][/], [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,441,441,48,45][/] and [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,490,441,48,45][/] for the ground properties.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Shortcuts II</string>
		<string>Holding Shift [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,931,395,48,45][/] while transfering items let you transfer multiple items at once.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Shortcuts III</string>
		<string>If you already selected an object or seed, you can double tap [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,98,487,48,45][/] or [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,784,441,48,45][/] to select the tool without having to navigate through the menu again.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Modify Ground's Wetness</string>
		<string>Use the bucket on the ground to modify the ground's wetness manually. You can even hold the left mouse button [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,30,359,29,35][/] and drag it around the ground to wet multiple tiles.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Compost</string>
		<string>To modify the ground's eutrophy, you need a filled dung bag. At first place a compost [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,100,150,50,50][/] somewhere and fill it with crops like barley [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,150,0,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Modify Ground's Eutrophy</string>
		<string>After the compost produced some dung, equip the dung bag ([scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,294,487,48,45][/]) and right click [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,60,359,29,35][/] on the compost.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Using the Dung Bag</string>
		<string>The dung bag gets filled and performing a left click [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=31,30,359,29,35][/] on the ground will increase the eutrophy by one.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Modify Windbreak</string>
		<string>Build wooden fences [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,0,150,50,50][/] or stone walls [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,50,150,50,50][/] to modify the windbreak. Both have different windbreak characteristics. Try them out!</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Seed Drop</string>
		<string>Fully grown crops drop seeds if harvested. The amount of seeds dropped increases over time, so waiting before harvesting increases the seed output.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Tree Spawning</string>
		<string>Big trees spawn woodpiles near them. They grow to sprouts and finally to small trees dependent on the ground's wetness and eutrophy.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Wood Quality</string>
		<string>If they are a small tree, their wood's [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] quality is zero [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,936,0,35,25][/] at first and increases over time up to wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/] of full quality [scale=1,true,false][icon=8,1152,0,35,25][/]. Place woodpiles [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,300,50,50][/] by yourself to farm wood [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,500,300,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Furnace</string>
		<string>Furnaces can use the pipe system, too. Therefore, you can lay out a furnace system where material is gathered from one chest and placed into another chest.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Pipes</string>
		<string>Production objects access nearby storages first, except the beer brewing kettle which tries to put its beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] into faucets first.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Faucet Filling</string>
		<string>A beer brewing kettle puts its beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] in a faucet and if the faucet is filled, it won't fill any other connected faucets to allow other kettles to fill the empty faucets with their beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/].</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Fill Multiple Faucets</string>
		<string>If you want multiple faucets with the same beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/], put some in these faucets because the brewing kettle will ignore this rule, if the faucet is already filled with beer [scale=0.5,true,false][icon=28,750,50,50,50][/] of the same type.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Rain Barrels</string>
		<string>Rain barrels get filled automatically if they stay outdoor during rain.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Winter Is Coming</string>
		<string>Try to gather enough resources for the beer production until winter comes, as nothing grows then while visitors keep visiting your inn.</string>
		<string>TIPS</string>
		
		<string>Here We Go!</string>
		<string>The tutorial is over. Good luck with your inn and perhaps you can complete the main questline with all the war taxes to pay?</string>
